# Daily

A mobile application that allows a user to create a to-do list and a highlight(main objective).

# What I Learned

* Kv language to create widgets under many screens/pages of the application.
* Creating widgets dynamically when the application is running. Ex: Creating a new to-do list item when the user presses the add button.
* BeautifulSoup4 to scrape online images from a website to be displayed in the application.
* Storing user input in a MySQL database.

# Difficulties Encountered

* Passing arguments to functions when binding callbacks.
* Accessing the camera roll of the user.
